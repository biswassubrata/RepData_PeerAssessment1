```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Read the data file
```{r echo = TRUE}
dat <- read.table("activity.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dat$date <- as.Date(dat$date)
dim(dat)
head(dat)
```
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r echo = TRUE}
aggregate(dat$steps, by=date, FUN=sum)
```
Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
